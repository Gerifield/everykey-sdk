To use this library in your code, just copy the contents in the
directory along side your own firmware code.

You'll need a copy of the `everykey` SDK folder located below this
directory.

E.g.

Your firmware is in:

    ../my_project

which contains

    $ ls
    main.c

You'll first need to copy (or link) the makefile and linker script from
the `everykey` sdk directory:

    $ cp ${everysdk}/everykey/makefile  .
    $ cp ${everysdk}/everykey/lp1342.ld .

Copy the `everykey` and `everykey_usb` directories:

    $ cp -r ${everysdk}/everykey .

Finally, copy or link the files in this directory:

    $ cp ${everysdk}/lib/everypio.h .
    $ cp ${everysdk}/lib/everypio.c .

The resulting directory looks will look like this:

    $ ls -l
    everykey
    everypio.c
    everypio.h
    lpc1343.ld
    main.c
    makefile
